# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
# CS 300 Course Projects

## Project Description

This repository contains two main components from the CS 300 course projects. The first component is an analysis of the runtime and memory usage for various data structures (vector, hash table, and binary search tree). The second component is a working code implementation for sorting and printing a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. This work showcases my understanding and application of data structures and algorithms.

## Reflection Questions and Answers

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In these projects, I tackled the problem of organizing and managing course data efficiently for a Computer Science program. The main tasks included loading data from a file, validating and storing it in different data structures (vector, hash table, and binary search tree), and implementing functions to search and print course information and prerequisites. Additionally, I focused on analyzing the runtime and memory usage of these data structures to determine the most efficient approach.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by first understanding the requirements and breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable components. Data structures are crucial because they directly affect the efficiency and performance of the program. Choosing the right data structure can optimize the operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and sorting. I used vectors for simplicity, hash tables for average-case efficiency, and binary search trees for balanced performance.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Whenever I encountered roadblocks, such as understanding complex data structure operations or debugging errors, I referred to course materials and documentation. Breaking down problems into smaller steps and writing pseudocode helped in visualizing and solving the issues systematically.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on this project has deepened my understanding of the importance of selecting appropriate data structures based on the specific requirements of a problem. It has taught me to consider both time and space complexity while designing software. The experience of implementing various data structures and analyzing their performance has equipped me with a better approach to tackle real-world problems efficiently.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project has emphasized the significance of writing clean, maintainable code. I learned to write modular code by dividing tasks into functions and using clear, descriptive names for variables and functions. Implementing data structures in a way that is adaptable to changes and easy to debug has improved my coding practices. Writing comprehensive comments and documentation has also become a priority to ensure that the code is understandable to others and future me.
